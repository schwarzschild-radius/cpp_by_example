# C++ Operators by Example

This module is part of the `cpp_by_example` repository and provides a comprehensive set of examples and exercises for understanding C++ operators. Each topic is divided into two parts:
- An **exercise file** to practice the concept
- A corresponding **solution file** with correct implementation

---

## Contents

This module covers the following types of C++ operators:

### 1. Arithmetic Operators
- Addition (`+`)
- Subtraction (`-`)
- Multiplication (`*`)
- Division (`/`)
- Modulus (`%`)

### 2. Relational Operators
- Equal to (`==`)
- Not equal to (`!=`)
- Greater than (`>`)
- Less than (`<`)
- Greater than or equal to (`>=`)
- Less than or equal to (`<=`)

### 3. Logical Operators
- Logical AND (`&&`)
- Logical OR (`||`)
- Logical NOT (`!`)

### 4. Bitwise Operators
- Bitwise AND (`&`)
- Bitwise OR (`|`)
- Bitwise XOR (`^`)
- Bitwise NOT (`~`)
- Left Shift (`<<`)
- Right Shift (`>>`)

### 5. Assignment Operators
- Simple assignment (`=`)
- Compound assignments (`+=`, `-=`, `*=`, `/=`, `%=`, etc.)

### 6. Miscellaneous Operators
- Sizeof (`sizeof`)
- Ternary Conditional (`? :`)
- Comma (`,`)
- Pointer Dereference (`*`)
- Address-of (`&`)
- Member Access via Pointer (`->`)
- Scope Resolution (`::`)

## How to Use

You can compile and run any `.cpp` file using a C++ compiler:

```bash
g++ filename.cpp -o output
./output
