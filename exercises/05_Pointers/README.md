# Pointers in C++

Pointers store the address of a variable, typically of other variables. They are essential for dynamic memory access and efficient array handling.


## Topics Covered


- Pointer access in 2D arrays
- Pointer arithmetic
- Double pointers
- Swapping two pointers
- Different types of pointers (normal, const, constexpr)
- Using `void*` and type casting
- Dangling pointer 
- Smart pointers (`shared_ptr`)
